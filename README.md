# Dino-Challenge-2D-Endless-Runner-Game-Engine-in-JavaScript
A 2D endless runner browser game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript featuring real-time animation, keyboard controls, collision detection, and scoring.


🦖 Dino Challenge — 2D Endless Runner Game Engine in JavaScript

Dino Challenge is a browser-based 2D endless runner game developed using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The game features a real-time animated dinosaur character that automatically runs forward while the player controls jumping using keyboard input to avoid dynamically generated obstacles.

The project demonstrates core game development concepts such as animation loops, collision detection, sprite handling, scoring systems, and state-based UI transitions — all implemented without external libraries.
